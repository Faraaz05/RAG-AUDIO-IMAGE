29
00:01:58.358 --> 00:02:08.973

SPEAKER_03: I will do that following a wider team meeting that was going to take place in the couple in a couple of weeks.

39
00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:56.435
SPEAKER_03: This is a great document now so that we can use this as showing what we've got going on in the coming year and our provision that we're going to be providing.

00:02:56.435 --> 00:02:59.446

41
00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:06.044

SPEAKER_03: Fantastic lovely thank you very much.

43
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:11.908
SPEAKER_03: But can I just ask how does it meet the appraisal objectives?

44
00:03:11.908 --> 00:03:23.147
SPEAKER_03: So the tasks that you are completing within the document they are individual tasks but I will build that into the appraisal meeting as part of the wider objectives that you were set in your last meeting.

45
00:03:23.147 --> 00:03:23.701

60
00:03:54.863 --> 00:04:00.500

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:27.960
SPEAKER_01: As you all know I sit on the charity committee and we've been asking up with some creative ideas for events to run next year so I thought maybe as we're all together we could take the opportunity to brainstorm a few things to take forward.

84
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.406
SPEAKER_03: Okay I think that's a great consideration that we need to make.

87
00:05:38.607 --> 00:05:43.066
SPEAKER_03: Morgan could you put that down as an action please for us to look at ready for the next meeting?

88
00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:43.319
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

89
00:05:43.673 --> 00:05:47.757
